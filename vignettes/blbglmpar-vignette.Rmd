## Introduction

The purpose of this package is to provide an alternative to existing Generalized Linear Model fitting package -`glm` - equipped with both parallelization and bootstrap capabilities. The goal is that one should be able to replace the package  `glm` with `blbglmpar` when there is a need for parallelization and bootstrap capabilities and things will just work. 

## Dependencies

`blbglmpar` uses a couple of packages so as to achieve the goal. The list of packages which serves as dependencies for include:

  * [`furrr`](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr) for parallelization
  * [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for efficient data manipulation
  * [`vroom`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/05/vroom-1-0-0/) for efficient lazy loading of large files data
  
## Usage

Loading blbglmpar into R-session.

```{r setup}
library(blbglmpar)
```
blbglmpar fits models using the template `blbglm(formula= formula, data = data, m = 10, B = 200, family = gaussian)`

The default behaviour of blbglmpar is that it does not run using parralellization and family is gaussian. Thus it works like the classical lm function but with bootstrap.

## Arguments

```{r}
a1 <- c("formula", "an object of class 'formula' (or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.")
a2 <- c("data", "an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from environment(formula), typically the environment from which lm is called")
a3 <- c("family", "a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the mode1. More about the family coube be found at https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/family.html")
a4 <- c("n", "number of splits data should be divided into")
a5 <- c("B", "number of resamples for bootstrap")
argframe <- matrix(rbind(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5), nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
argframe %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```


## Logistic regression example


```{r}
df_bin <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")
df_bin$rank <- as.factor(df_bin$rank)
fit_bin <- blbglm(admit ~ gre+gpa,data = df_bin, m = 5, B = 10, family = "binomial")
coef(fit_bin)

```

We compute the confidence interval for the coefficients of gre and gpa. For all confidence interval, the default is alpha level of .05

```{r}
confint(fit_bin, c("gre", "gpa"))
```

We compute the variance of the the fit.

```{r}
sigma(fit_bin)
```

```{r}
sigma(fit_bin, confidence = TRUE)
```

We predict the outcome for new data.

```{r}
predict(fit_bin, data.frame(gre = c(600, 560), gpa = c(3.67, 3.5)))
```
```{r}
predict(fit_bin, data.frame(gre = c(600, 560), gpa = c(3.67, 3.5)), confidence = TRUE)
```

## Parallelization

We specify the number of workers

```{r}
library(furrr)

suppressWarnings(plan(multiprocess, workers = 2))

```
```{r}
df_bin <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")
df_bin$rank <- as.factor(df_bin$rank)
fit_bin <- blbglm(admit ~ gre+gpa,data = df_bin, m = 5, B = 100, family = "binomial")
coef(fit_bin)

```
```{r}
df_bin <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")
df_bin$rank <- as.factor(df_bin$rank)
fit_bin <- blbglm(admit ~ gre+gpa,data = df_bin, m = 5, B = 100, family = "binomial")
coef(fit_bin)
```

We stop the workers

```{r}
future:::ClusterRegistry("stop")
```
